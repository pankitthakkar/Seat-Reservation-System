# Seat-Reservation-System
Colossus Airlines acquires a second plane (total capacity of 12) and expands its service to four flights daily (Flights 102, 311, 444, and 519). Expand the program to handle four flights. Have a top-level menu that offers a choice of flights and the option to quit. Selecting a particular flight should then bring up a booking menu. However, one new item should be added: confirming a seat assignment. Also, the quit choice should be replaced with the choice of exiting to the top-level menu. Each display should indicate which flight is currently being handled. Also, the seat assignment display should indicate the confirmation status.
